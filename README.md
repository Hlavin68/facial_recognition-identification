# facial_recognition-identification
# Simple facial recognition, I have implimented MTCNN and deepface modules
# MTCNN for identifying human faces on an image and added some code there to draw a rectangle around the detected face
# Deepface for matching the detected faces to a dataset of images and returns a dataframe with the found matching faces identity
